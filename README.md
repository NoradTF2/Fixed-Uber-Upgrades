# Fixed Uber Upgrades
This is a public modification of Uberupgrades. I mainly feel this is needed due to the abandonment of the owner.

If you want to run it, add "sm plugins reload tf2attributes_ubup" to server.cfg so your uberupgrades will actually load every time your server restarts or map changes.

# Prerequisites
You'll need these plugins:
TF2Attributes (https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes/releases)

TF2Items (https://builds.limetech.io/?project=tf2items)

TFEconData (https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconData)

TFEconDataCompat (https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconDataCompat)

Dhooks (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2588686&postcount=589)

If you want to compile the plugin itself, you'll need to download the TF2ItemsInfo include file.

Don't bother me for help. I've quit working on things that aren't worth my time.
